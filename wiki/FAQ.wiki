  # *!TongueTied fails to start in Tomcat after being deployed in Linux.*
    This is related to the tomcat security manager. In the file /etc/init.d/tomcat6 change the value TOMCAT_SECURITY=yes to TOMCAT_SECURITY=no. Please note this is a temporary solution until a better recommendation can be made.
  # *What is a "Default" bundle?*
    The concept of a Default bundle is really just to help make creating translations easier and save some mouse clicks. When a new keyword is created then the translations are assigned the "Default" bundle by default. The default can change over time but there is only ever 1 default bundle at one time. 
  # *What is a "Global" bundle?*
    A bundle marked as global means that the global translations will be included as part of the export. There can be many global bundles but a global bundle is not required to use !TongueTied. It works like this, for example:

    myBundle has the keywords:
    {{{
    key.one=one
    key.two=two
    }}}
    globalBundle has the keywords:
    {{{
    key.two=2
    key.three=3
    }}}
    So when the export is performed, you will get for myBundle:
    {{{
    key.one=one
    key.two=two
    key.three=3
    }}}
    When doing an export the user has the option whether to include the global translations in every export.
