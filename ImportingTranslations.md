# Introduction #

TongueTied allows you to import existing resource files into the system.


# Details #

  1. Select the "Import / Export" tab
  1. Select the "Import" option. **N.B.** The Languages, Countries and Resource bundles need to pre-exist in the system in order for resources to be imported.
  1. Browse for the file resource to import.
  1. Select the type of resource file you are importing e.g. Java properties, .Net resource, CSV, etc.
    1. If you selected a Java properties file or .Net resource file, then you can also over write the bundle by choosing a bundle. This is primarily used as differentiators for importing global values or if your resource bundle has sub-directories.
  1. Select the state for each imported translation. Whilst this value is mandatory, it is only of value if you plan to utilise the work flow in TongueTied.
  1. Click on the "import" button.
